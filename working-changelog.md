### StarTech
- New craftable weapon: Pulse Rifle - a quick, effective hitscan assault rifle at range, a devastating plasma burst shotgun up close.
- Power costs for Pulse Weapons have been overhauled and are now proportional to weapon damage for a given action. This includes the weapon's own (skill tree) damage multiplier, but not bonuses from armor or other sources.
- Pulsestrike Glaive now plays an indicator sound when fully charged, and charges faster when buffered off the combo finisher
- Nanofield users now find themselves able to ~~roll around at the speed of sound~~ grind on rails. Hold down and sprint to land on one!
- Pulse weapon tool tips now take attack speed into account
- Gave Pulsestrike Glaive a bit of a balance pass; full damage plus attack speed had it sitting at tier 9 DPS with too little investment
- Fixed an issue where drive bays would fail to drop their drives when broken if not connected to a controller (*heavy sigh*)
- Fixed an issue where drive configuration couldn't be edited while disconnected

### Stardust Core
