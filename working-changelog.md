### StarTech
- Autosmelter now places outputs in existing stacks if present (this includes input slots, so refeeding is possible)
- Autosmelter "take all" now pulls input slot items if no recipe for them exists, or if there aren't enough to start smelting
- All tiers of Flux Relay now also serve as Transmatter Network relays
- Fixed Elytra accelerating oddly in water and other fluids with Frackin Universe installed
