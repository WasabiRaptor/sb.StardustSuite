### StarTech
- New craftable weapon: Pulse Rifle - a quick, effective hitscan assault rifle at range, a devastating plasma burst shotgun up close.
- Power costs for Pulse Weapons have been overhauled and are now proportional to weapon damage for a given action. This includes the weapon's own (skill tree) damage multiplier, but not bonuses from armor or other sources.
- Pulsestrike Glaive now plays an indicator sound when fully charged, and charges faster when buffered off the combo finisher
- pulse rifle
- grinding
- Fixed an issue where drive bays would fail to drop their drives when broken if not connected to a controller (*heavy sigh*)
- Fixed an issue where drive configuration couldn't be edited while disconnected
