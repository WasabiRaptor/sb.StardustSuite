~ Stardust Core Lite [b][i]or[/i][/b] Stardust Core [b]required[/b]! ~

A UI revamp powered by metaGUI, aiming to bring themability and general system improvement to as many aspects of Starbound as possible.

- Dynamic panes for all standard containers
-- Item sorting (independently of ES)
-- Full support for Enhanced Storage container options

Item search is coming as soon as I figure out how to work it into the UI design >_>
