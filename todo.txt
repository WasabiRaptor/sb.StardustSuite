next things {
    figure out a good generalist endgame elytra (pre-eidolon)
    ^ Essentia Booster; decent flight time but not unlimited, probably has blink
    ^ essence spark particle effect?
    
    need a t4 or t5 one to go in between
    
    heat gauge stats in nanofield? efficiency, cooldown rate, cooldown delay reduction?
    
    some way of toggling AP gain display
    toggle nodes
    
    - conditions (including aliased) in metacrafting
    
    compatId (+refund)
    reset catalyst (how should this work...?)
    
    probably some refund of AP from already-catalyst'd items?
}

the BIG IDEA UPDATE {
    backend stuff {
        - figure out why multiline labels occasionally cut off a pixel on the bottom
        
        metaGUI custom tooltip system (very similar to context menus)
        
        ? metaGUI module system (requires some slight reworks) {
            container layout, immediately containing module UI
            script loaded just before containing UI
            ... nesting?
            need to make it possible for named stuff to place its proxy elsewhere...?
            actually, needs to be basically a widget subclass in order to have multiple of the same module?
        }
        
        tabs for metaGUI (eventually)
    }
    dialogue tree system {
        metagui, fixed window; can intercept escape due to how keyboard capture works
        dialogue is just lua coroutines
        informal function call syntax makes a lot of sense for this
        "accumulator" with active word wrap, processed on addition?
        choice system, responds both to mouse and keyboard; option to have last choice as "default no" (escape)
        letter-by-letter display is just part of the coroutine workings
        customizable name heading, portrait display, talkboops
        automatic paging
        by default, automatic spacing between puts ("word array"-ish mechanics)
        all spacing and newlines autocollapsed to a single space; explicit newline tag
        specialized wait command that skips over if in "rush mode" {
            triggered by hitting escape during display *or* at page wait
            instant display until page
        }
    }
    complete pulse equipment rework {
        - Aetheri-style trees but tied to the item (and in a metaGUI window)
        - global AP system (gathered from combat and the like; basically Aetheri's but usable for multiple things)
        reset catalyst refunds everything invested into an item's progression
        is AP gifting a bug or a feature?
        
        - elytra rework; separate socketable components (slots as part of the nanofield tree?)
        - heat gauge for flight
        - heat rises very slowly with hovering, at a normal pace when moving, and much faster when boosting
        - cooldown starts upon landing on the ground, or after a certain time passes with *no* heat generation, or while underwater
        - maybe cooldown ramp similar to Terraria mana regen; cool down faster at lower heat levels
        
        - separate heat values for space and atmosphere (you want to be able to navigate space)
        maybe heat rises faster when pulling against gravity?
        
        - heat disabled entirely on player ships
        
        - t1 elytra is just a pair of rocket boosters; very quick overheat, but immune to disruption
        - move sphere mode to double tapping down
        swappable spheres
    }
    eidolon hunting {
        something you can build at endgame to enable queuing (within the same map)? can build lobbies on mp servers
        huge, ancient crystalline constructs, maybe Aetheri-related?
        scales independently of tier system, drops a lot of AP and components for things (Kinetic Field Cores anyone?)
        unlimited elytra flight in atmosphere gated behind your first few eidolons (or at least someone's)
    }
}

for (maybe not) next update {
    terminal quick stack?
    convert combustion gen and autosmelter UI
    also configurator
    
} then {
    pulse rifle
    flux knives
    give the glaive a light source paired with energy
    
    proper tool tip for fp-containing objects
    
} then {
    customizable elements for pulse weapons (via configurator)
    give Pulsestrike Glaive a secondary that isn't just the combo finisher
    maybe an alt finisher to main fire combo if buffered during?
    rework phase drill to be tiered and also maybe a dynitem
    have all recipes unlocked by default
    pulse chakram similar to razorwave
}

attempt to diagnose drive corruption {
    happens consistently after reloading if you have a second drive in the same bay as a fully loaded 256k
    corrupts the second drive
    does not happen with a fresh drive in a separate bay
}

? hook engine {
    included by replaced util.lua
    hijacks the first setting of _ENV.init to hook into core tables (widget, player etc.)
}

! TRADING SYSTEM {
    part of stardustlib; basically Path of Exile's trade UI
    quickbar button puts an item in cursor; clicking on a player prompts them to accept/reject trade, via playerext
    right click dismisses without trading, and emits a sound effect to the player (might need UI shenanigans for local sfx?)
    cursor item should make it look like a trade-icon cursor, if that's achievable
    on (unexpected) uninit, spawn a stagehand at player position that lasts for ~.5sec and deletes cursor item from anywhere it can find
    (consume item drops, consume from containers within reach, consume from player inventory)
}

sb.jsonQuery exists, adjust itemutil.property?

turn the liquid accumulator (phase drill, excavate) into a prefab

configurable tram stop {
  built-in player sensor
}

reserve material ID range somewhere
semigloss black hull panel

x BYOS functionality as machine { // probably incompatible with FU's version
    damageTileArea with ridiculously high strength and harvest level and radius big enough to cover a t8 vanilla ship from one end, in both fg and bg
    itemDropQuery and collect into database
    upgrade player ship to custom tier to get rid of bg image and collision material
    force-kill objects set "residual" by Hacking them and using object.smash
}
patch warp state matching into encounter variations of booster flames (/objects/ship/boosters/)
add distinguishing names to even/odd small booster flames
lots of shiny new ship components, especially animating ones that match their state to flight {
    warp cores should count as FU ones, if possible
}

move tag patches to stardustlib and add some more {
    "component", "material" etc.
}

power stuffs {
    nanofield {
        configuration panel accessed via picking up one of the static fields
        elytra: use an actual item
    }
    
    Resonite Reactor!
    
    fluxsaber - fluxpulse-charged beamsword, high combo potential especially when wearing nanofield or other control tech
    pulse rifle - hitscan machine gun with shotgun secondary
    vector rifle - railgun sniper with mechanics similar to Splatoon's chargers or Warframe's Ferrox
    artemis bow - bouncy ray a la the shadowbeam staff from Terraria
    
    maybe a way to add a pulse battery to stock equipment
    
    powered lamp that fills a large region with full-bright light (basically volumetric lighting at the cost of fp)
    
    more smelter-type machines
    ^ chance bias stat (inverse exponent to random number)
    
    prefix and move power categories to stardustlib?
    
    eventually make transmatter network require power (after rewrite)
}

compost bin that makes food age faster, for use as biofuel
^ some sort of powered processor to make (liquid) biodiesel?

renamer (custom shortdescription, put vanilla one as category because tooltip)

some item transport for automation (and library to make use of input/output configuration)
networked wire I/O ports

metaGUI {
    FU contrib checklist {
        - some work on theme frame
        - license
        - primer
        > test and send PR
    }
    
    eventually {
        icon support for buttons
        debug console pane via common-table
        rework preferredSize to take both a width and a height?
        keyboard layouts...
        
        it's technically possible to use metatable shenanigans to have the pane script survive a f8 reload?
    }
    
    widgets needed {
        tab field! {
            probably layout with a set of panels, attached to a scrollable area of basically dressed-up buttons
            tabs on any edge or hidden (can be manually flipped through)
            event onTabChanged
        }
    }
}

ipc lib {
    weakly-keyed by _ENV for automatic cleanup
}

Extend sync library {
    //Recognize RpcPromise returning another RpcPromise and replace in queue
    
    actually, response system with a proper response-message instead of just an RpcPromise
    generate responseID with makeuuid? register with an anonymous function for continuation of operation after response
    
    coroutine-based things? ...
    
    fixed sync registry (register callback ahead of time; optional automatic timer)
}

Aetheri species mod {
    
    Androgynous, fullbright "core" (novakid male minus chest definition, with Avian-ish talons) with crystalline plates on top
    (part of innate armor); hue and brightness sliders for core, fine-grained control over what plates you have
    
    AP sharing?
    "aether channeling" for particular weapon types (back up energy bar using aether when wielding specific weapon types)
    
    figure out crit conditions for innates other than sniper
    actually put crit multiplier somewhere on the tree
    crit rate (multiplier on base chance, bonus timing length etc.)
    
    make flight in air use aether; place behind unlock, add efficiency stat
    
    Innates {
        ! standardize on a separate tag (energyColor?) for replace directives
        
        Kinetic Burst {
            refine secondary, place after unlock?
            different secondary in water and zero-g?
        }
        Sniper Shot {
            give it a final name!
            figure out a secondary; overheat shot?
        }
        Shatterflurry? Shredflurry? rapid fire spread salvo similar to Terraria's Crystal Storm
        Fireball
        Charge Cannon (roughly mega man X style; secondary could be a melee attack?)
        PUNCHY PUNCH
        Shield Spheres {
            kind of like magnorbs meets Mega Man shield weapons (or Mei's tears from that BoI:A+ mod)
            primary to fire them off, secondary to make them spin faster and deflect projectiles
            maybe always active with knockback but not damage? takes yeeting them off to actually dps
        }
        Artemis Bow - both single (piercing?) and spread shots
        Shatterpulse - wide radial pulse that cuts armor down but doesn't do much damage
    }
    
    Skill tree {
        "node keys" (catalysts?) dropped rarely by mobs depending on level, used as gate costs
        use a vault key to gate off some lategame clusters
        item for refunding nodes (stone of reattunement?)
    }
    
    Hunger system {
        Stat locked so that food doesn't replenish; instead, it's based on exposure to the stars
        Regenerates in about a minute when exposed to sun or starlight; 2-3x faster while on ship
    }
}

// Transmatter network reimplementation { // not sure if it's needed or if drive bays just need further fixing up
    Controller {
        API {
            callable via both callScriptedEntity and sendEntityMessage
            each request runs as a coroutine placed on a queue for suspendability and environment cleanliness
            
            ...
        }
        Network Scan Module {
            periodically scans the network pool, assembles the list of storage devices and notifies peripherals
        }
    }
}
