[h1]A leap in technology unlocks boundless potential.[/h1]

Construct complex machines to do your gruntwork for you; batteries and generators to power them.
Wield an arsenal of unique and powerful tools and weaponry.
Leave traditional armor by the wayside and don a Nanofield, powering your arsenal and taking to the skies upon wings of steel and starlight.

Meet friendly Fenthes on your travels, hunt ancient and powerful Eidolons alongside them, or perhaps even begin an entirely new adventure as one...?

[b]Explore your universe anew.[/b]

This mod is still a work in progress, so expect some rough edges or missing features.

Quick primer on Transmatter Networks:
- Craft and place *one* Transmatter Controller per network (any more and things will break!)
- Craft and place any number of Terminals, Storage Buses and Drive Bays and hook them up to the controller via wire
- - Network Relays will allow indirect connection, for distance or tidiness

Terminals provide access to the items in the network
Storage Buses link external storage to the network
- Right-click with a wrench (made at an anvil) to change direction (indicated by the blue highlight)
- Shift+right-click to configure filters and priority
Drive Bays read/write inserted Transmatter Drives to provide compact, portable storage
- Click the button next to a slot to configure that drive's filter/priority

Ingame documentation coming soon; meanwhile, here's a tutorial Kriana wrote up:
